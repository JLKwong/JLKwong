### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineering intern seeking to apply my experience with software quality assurance testing,
hardware/software troubleshooting and testing, software development, embedded systems, low-level
programming, grit, resilience, interpersonal skills, and organizational skills in a gender-inclusive software
engineering career. I have 9 months of experience automating IT tasks using **Python**/batch scripts and modifying an
Oracle **SQL** database.

I have overcome many adverse hardships; including racism, sexism, denial of education, temporary disability, and financial hardship; by progressively mastering tasks, achieving milestones, seeking mentors and peers in the field, surrounding myself with positivity and supportive people in the field, leveraging the adrenaline boost from stress to get tasks done, and bouncing back from setbacks using mindfulness techniques. For example, one way I exposed myself to new mentors and peers in software engineering was by attending TechTogether Atlanta, where I **won the 'Best Work From Home Hack' among over 320 competitors** by coding and designing an educational web-based adventure game in 44 hours. Additionally, I have **landed a software engineering internship in my gap before college**. I have my eyes set on several competitive universities, including Caltech and ETH ZÃ¼rich.

I'm a curious and nerdy foodie who enjoys learning, reading, and having deep, esoteric conversations. I like to eat out, play D&D, play video games, watch speedruns, and watch anime. One of my main aspirations is to reduce measurable causes of racism and queerphobia by funding evidence-based services that empower genderqueer POC.
